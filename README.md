# Employee API Project

Welcome to the Employee API Project! This is a FastAPI-based web application that allows you to manage employee records securely. It includes user authentication (signup/login) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employees. The project uses Docker for easy setup, PostgreSQL as the database, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate a secure RESTful API for managing employee data. Itâ€™s ideal for learning FastAPI, database integration with SQLAlchemy, and JWT authentication. The system ensures only authenticated users can perform actions like adding or deleting employee records.

## Features
- User registration and login with JWT tokens.
- CRUD operations for employees (add, view, update, delete).
- Pagination for listing employees.
- Secure password hashing and token validation.
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment.
- Swagger UI for API testing (`/docs`).

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**: For running the app and database containers. Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository. Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Optional**: A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for viewing/editing code.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
